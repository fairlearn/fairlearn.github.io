Metrics with Multiple Features
==============================

This notebook demonstrates the new API for metrics, which supports
multiple sensitive and conditional features. This example does not
contain a proper discussion of how fairness relates to the dataset
used, although it does highlight issues which users may want to
consider when analysing their datasets.

We are going to consider a lending scenario, supposing that we have
a model which predicts whether or not a particular customer will
repay a loan. This could be used as the basis of deciding whether
or not to offer that customer a loan. With traditional metrics,
we would assess the model using:

- The 'true' values from the test set
- The model predictions from the test set

Our fairness metrics compute group-based fairness statistics.
To use these, we also need categorical columns from the test
set. For this example, we will include:

- The sex of each individual (two unique values)
- The race of each individual (three unique values)
- The credit score band of each individual (three unique values)
- Whether the loan is considered 'large' or 'small'

An individual's sex and race should not affect a lending decision,
but it would be legitimate to consider an individual's credit score
and the relative size of the loan which they desired.

A real scenario will be more complicated, but this will serve to
illustrate the use of the new metrics.

Getting the Data
================

*This section may be skipped. It simply creates a dataset for
illustrative purposes*

We will use the well-known UCI 'Adult' dataset as the basis of this
demonstration. This is not for a lending scenario, but we will regard
it as one for the purposes of this example. We will use the existing
'race' and 'sex' columns (trimming the former to three unique values),
and manufacture credit score bands and loan sizes from other columns.
We start with some uncontroversial `import` statements:


.. code-block:: default


    import functools
    import numpy as np

    import sklearn.metrics as skm
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
    from sklearn.compose import make_column_selector as selector
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
    from fairlearn.metrics import selection_rate









Next, we import the data:


.. code-block:: default


    data = fetch_openml(data_id=1590, as_frame=True)
    X_raw = data.data
    y = (data.target == '>50K') * 1








For purposes of clarity, we consolidate the 'race' column to have
three unique values:


.. code-block:: default



    def race_transform(input_str):
        """Reduce values to White, Black and Other."""
        result = 'Other'
        if input_str == 'White' or input_str == 'Black':
            result = input_str
        return result


    X_raw['race'] = X_raw['race'].map(race_transform).fillna('Other').astype('category')
    print(np.unique(X_raw['race']))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
    Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead

    See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy
      X_raw['race'] = X_raw['race'].map(race_transform).fillna('Other').astype('category')
    ['Black' 'Other' 'White']




Now, we manufacture the columns for the credit score band and
requested loan size. These are wholly constructed, and not
part of the actual dataset in any way. They are simply for
illustrative purposes.


.. code-block:: default



    def marriage_transform(m_s_string):
        """Perform some simple manipulations."""
        result = 'Low'
        if m_s_string.startswith("Married"):
            result = 'Medium'
        elif m_s_string.startswith("Widowed"):
            result = 'High'
        return result


    def occupation_transform(occ_string):
        """Perform some simple manipulations."""
        result = 'Small'
        if occ_string.startswith("Machine"):
            result = 'Large'
        return result


    col_credit = X_raw['marital-status'].map(marriage_transform).fillna('Low')
    col_credit.name = "Credit Score"
    col_loan_size = X_raw['occupation'].map(occupation_transform).fillna('Small')
    col_loan_size.name = "Loan Size"

    A = X_raw[['race', 'sex']]
    A['Credit Score'] = col_credit
    A['Loan Size'] = col_loan_size
    A

Now that we have imported our dataset and manufactured a few features, we
can perform some more conventional processing. To avoid the problem of
`data leakage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)>`_,
we need to split the data into training and test sets before applying
any transforms or scaling:


.. code-block:: default



    (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, A_train, A_test) = train_test_split(
        X_raw, y, A, test_size=0.3, random_state=54321, stratify=y
    )

    # Ensure indices are aligned between X, y and A,
    # after all the slicing and splitting of DataFrames
    # and Series

    X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)
    y_train = y_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    y_test = y_test.reset_index(drop=True)
    A_train = A_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    A_test = A_test.reset_index(drop=True)








Next, we build two :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects
to process the columns, one for numeric data, and the other
for categorical data. Both impute missing values; the difference
is whether the data are scaled (numeric columns) or
one-hot encoded (categorical columns). Imputation of missing
values should generally be done with care, since it could
potentially introduce biases. Of course, removing rows with
missing data could also cause trouble, if particular subgroups
have poorer data quality.


.. code-block:: default


    numeric_transformer = Pipeline(
        steps=[
            ("impute", SimpleImputer()),
            ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
        ]
    )
    categorical_transformer = Pipeline(
        [
            ("impute", SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")),
            ("ohe", OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")),
        ]
    )
    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
        transformers=[
            ("num", numeric_transformer, selector(dtype_exclude="category")),
            ("cat", categorical_transformer, selector(dtype_include="category")),
        ]
    )








With our preprocessor defined, we can now build a
new pipeline which includes an Estimator:


.. code-block:: default


    unmitigated_predictor = Pipeline(
        steps=[
            ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
            (
                "classifier",
                LogisticRegression(solver="liblinear", fit_intercept=True),
            ),
        ]
    )








With the pipeline fully defined, we can first train it
with the training data, and then generate predictions
from the test data.


.. code-block:: default


    unmitigated_predictor.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = unmitigated_predictor.predict(X_test)









Analysing the Model with Metrics
================================

After our data manipulations and model training, we have the following
from our test set:

- A vector of true values called ``y_test``
- A vector of model predictions called ``y_pred``
- A DataFrame of categorical features relevant to fairness called ``A_test``

In a traditional model analysis, we would now look at some metrics
evaluated on the entire dataset. Suppose in this case, the relevant
metrics are :func:`fairlearn.metrics.selection_rate` and
:func:`sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score` (with
``beta=0.6``).
We can evaluate these metrics directly:


.. code-block:: default


    print("Selection Rate:", selection_rate(y_test, y_pred))
    print("fbeta:", skm.fbeta_score(y_test, y_pred, beta=0.6))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Selection Rate: 0.1947041561454992
    fbeta: 0.6827826864569057




We know that there are sensitive features in our data, and we want to
ensure that we're not harming individuals due to membership in any of
these groups. For this purpose, Fairlearn provides the
:class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
class. Let us construct an instance of this class, and then look at
its capabilities:


.. code-block:: default


    fbeta_06 = functools.partial(skm.fbeta_score, beta=0.6)

    metric_fns = {'selection_rate': selection_rate, 'fbeta_06': fbeta_06}

    grouped_on_sex = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                 y_test, y_pred,
                                 sensitive_features=A_test['sex'])








The :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object requires a
minimum of four arguments:

1. The underlying metric function(s) to be evaluated
2. The true values
3. The predicted values
4. The sensitive feature values

These are all passed as arguments to the constructor. If more than
one underlying metric is required (as in this case), then we must
provide them in a dictionary.

The underlying metrics must have a signature ``fn(y_true, y_pred)``,
so we have to use :func:`functools.partial` on ``fbeta_score()`` to
furnish ``beta=0.6`` (we will show how to pass in extra array
arguments such as sample weights shortly).

We will now take a closer look at the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
object. First, there is the ``overall`` property, which contains
the metrics evaluated on the entire dataset. We see that this contains the
same values calculated above:


.. code-block:: default


    assert grouped_on_sex.overall['selection_rate'] == selection_rate(y_test, y_pred)
    assert grouped_on_sex.overall['fbeta_06'] == skm.fbeta_score(y_test, y_pred, beta=0.6)
    print(grouped_on_sex.overall)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    selection_rate    0.194704
    fbeta_06          0.682783
    dtype: object




The other property in the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object
is ``by_group``. This contains the metrics evaluated on each subgroup defined
by the categories in the ``sensitive_features=`` argument. In this case, we
have results for males and females:


.. code-block:: default


    grouped_on_sex.by_group






.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .dataframe tbody tr th {
            vertical-align: top;
        }

        .dataframe thead th {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>
    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
      <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
          <th></th>
          <th>selection_rate</th>
          <th>fbeta_06</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>sex</th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Female</th>
          <td>0.0688301</td>
          <td>0.634014</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Male</th>
          <td>0.25675</td>
          <td>0.689789</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

We can immediately see a substantial disparity in the selection rate between
males and females.

We can also create another :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object
using race as the sensitive feature:


.. code-block:: default


    grouped_on_race = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                  y_test, y_pred,
                                  sensitive_features=A_test['race'])








The ``overall`` property is unchanged:


.. code-block:: default

    assert (grouped_on_sex.overall == grouped_on_race.overall).all()








The ``by_group`` property now contains the metrics evaluated based on the 'race'
column:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.by_group






.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .dataframe tbody tr th {
            vertical-align: top;
        }

        .dataframe thead th {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>
    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
      <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
          <th></th>
          <th>selection_rate</th>
          <th>fbeta_06</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>race</th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Black</th>
          <td>0.0681976</td>
          <td>0.592125</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Other</th>
          <td>0.16763</td>
          <td>0.693717</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>White</th>
          <td>0.210715</td>
          <td>0.686081</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

We see that there is also a significant disparity in selection rates when
grouping by race.

Sample weights and other arrays
-------------------------------

We noted above that the underlying metric functions passed to the
:class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` constructor need to be of
the form ``fn(y_true, y_pred)`` - we do not support scalar arguments
such as ``pos_label=`` or ``beta=`` in the constructor. Such
arguments should be bound into a new function using
:func:`functools.partial`, and the result passed in. However, we do
support arguments which have one entry for each sample, with an array
of sample weights being the most common example. These are divided
into subgroups along with ``y_true`` and ``y_pred``, and passed along
to the underlying metric.

To use these arguments, we pass in a dictionary as the ``sample_params=``
argument of the constructor. Let us generate some random weights, and
pass these along:


.. code-block:: default


    random_weights = np.random.rand(len(y_test))

    example_sample_params = {
        'selection_rate': {'sample_weight': random_weights},
        'fbeta_06': {'sample_weight': random_weights},
    }


    grouped_with_weights = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                       y_test, y_pred,
                                       sensitive_features=A_test['sex'],
                                       sample_params=example_sample_params)








We can inspect the overall values, and check they are as expected:


.. code-block:: default

    assert grouped_with_weights.overall['selection_rate'] == \
        selection_rate(y_test, y_pred, sample_weight=random_weights)
    assert grouped_with_weights.overall['fbeta_06'] == \
        skm.fbeta_score(y_test, y_pred, beta=0.6, sample_weight=random_weights)
    print(grouped_with_weights.overall)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    selection_rate    0.196387
    fbeta_06          0.681955
    dtype: object




We can also see the effect on the metric being evaluated on the subgroups:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_with_weights.by_group

Quantifying Disparities
=======================

We now know that our model is selecting individuals who are female far less
often than individuals who are male. There is a similar effect when
examining the results by race, with blacks being selected far less often than
whites (and those classified as 'other'). However, there are many cases where
presenting all these numbers at once will not be useful (for example, a high
level dashboard which is monitoring model performance). Fairlearn provides
several means of aggregating metrics across the subgroups, so that disparities
can be readily quantified.

The simplest of these aggregations is ``group_min()``, which reports the
minimum value seen for a subgroup for each underlying metric (we also provide
``group_max()``). This is
useful if there is a mandate that "no subgroup should have an ``fbeta_score()``
of less than 0.6." We can evaluate the minimum values easily:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.group_min()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.0681976
    fbeta_06           0.592125
    dtype: object



As noted above, the selection rates varies greatly by race and by sex.
This can be quantified in terms of a difference between the subgroup with
the highest value of the metric, and the subgroup with the lowest value.
For this, we provide the method ``difference(method='between_groups)``:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.difference(method='between_groups')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.142518
    fbeta_06          0.101591
    dtype: float64



We can also evaluate the difference relative to the corresponding overall
value of the metric. In this case we take the absolute value, so that the
result is always positive:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.difference(method='to_overall')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.126507
    fbeta_06          0.090657
    dtype: float64



There are situations where knowing the ratios of the metrics evaluated on
the subgroups is more useful. For this we have the ``ratio()`` method.
We can take the ratios between the minimum and maximum values of each metric:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.ratio(method='between_groups')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.323648
    fbeta_06          0.853555
    dtype: object



We can also compute the ratios relative to the overall value for each
metric. Analogous to the differences, the ratios are always in the range
:math:`[0,1]`:


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.ratio(method='to_overall')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.350263
    fbeta_06          0.867223
    dtype: float64



Intersections of Features
=========================

So far we have only considered a single sensitive feature at a time,
and we have already found some serious issues in our example data.
However, sometimes serious issues can be hiding in intersections of
features. For example, the
`Gender Shades project <https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/gender-shades/overview/>`_
found that facial recognition algorithms performed worse for blacks
than whites, and also worse for women than men (despite overall high
accuracy score). Moreover, performance on black females was *terrible*.
We can examine the intersections of sensitive features by passing
multiple columns to the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
constructor:


.. code-block:: default


    grouped_on_race_and_sex = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                          y_test, y_pred,
                                          sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']])








The overall values are unchanged, but the ``by_group`` table now
shows the intersections between subgroups:


.. code-block:: default

    assert (grouped_on_race_and_sex.overall == grouped_on_race.overall).all()
    grouped_on_race_and_sex.by_group






.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .dataframe tbody tr th {

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th rowspan="2" valign="top">Black</th>
          <th>Female</th>
          <td>0.0322581</td>
          <td>0.630316</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Male</th>
          <td>0.103591</td>
          <td>0.580624</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th rowspan="2" valign="top">Other</th>
          <th>Female</th>
          <td>0.0708661</td>
          <td>0.503704</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Male</th>
          <td>0.223744</td>
          <td>0.728972</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <th>Female</th>

          <td>0.642076</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Male</th>
          <td>0.271235</td>
          <td>0.692069</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

The aggregations are still performed across all subgroups for each metric,
so each continues to reduce to a single value. If we look at the
``group_min()``, we see that we violate the mandate we specified for the
``fbeta_score()`` suggested above (for females with a race of 'Other' in
fact):


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race_and_sex.group_min()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate    0.0322581
    fbeta_06           0.503704
    dtype: object



Looking at the ``ratio()`` method, we see that the disparity is worse
(specifically between white males and black females, if we check in
the ``by_group`` table):


.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race_and_sex.ratio(method='between_groups')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    selection_rate     0.11893
    fbeta_06          0.690978
    dtype: object



Control Features
================

There is a further way we can slice up our data. We have (*completely
made up*) features for the individuals' credit scores (in three bands)
and also the size of the loan requested (large or small). In our loan
scenario, it is acceptable that individuals with high credit scores
are selected more often than individuals with low credit scores.
However, within each credit score band, we do not want a disparity
between (say) black females and white males. To example these cases,
we have the concept of *control features*.

Control features are introduced by the ``control_features=``
argument to the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                    y_test, y_pred,
                                    sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']],
                                    control_features=A_test['Credit Score'])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1465: UndefinedMetricWarning: F-score is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 due to no true nor predicted samples. Use `zero_division` parameter to control this behavior.
      average, "true nor predicted", 'F-score is', len(true_sum)




This has an immediate effect on the ``overall`` property. Instead
of having one value for each metric, we now have a value for each
unique value of the control feature:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score.overall






.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .dataframe tbody tr th {
            vertical-align: top;
        }

        .dataframe thead th {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>
    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
      <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
          <th></th>
          <th>selection_rate</th>
          <th>fbeta_06</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Credit Score</th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>High</th>
          <td>0.0361702</td>
          <td>0.664928</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Low</th>
          <td>0.0229238</td>
          <td>0.549994</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Medium</th>
          <td>0.386924</td>
          <td>0.695034</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

The ``by_group`` property is similarly expanded:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score.by_group






.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

        .dataframe tbody tr th {
            vertical-align: top;
        }

        .dataframe thead th {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>
    <table border="1" class="dataframe">

The aggregates are also evaluated once for each group identified
by the control feature:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score.group_min()

And:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score.ratio(method='between_groups')






.. raw:: html

    <div>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

In our data, we see that we have a dearth of positive results
for high income non-whites, which significantly affects the
aggregates.

We can continue adding more control features:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_both = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                            y_test, y_pred,
                            sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']],
                            control_features=A_test[['Loan Size', 'Credit Score']])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

      average, "true nor predicted", 'F-score is', len(true_sum)
    Found 36 subgroups. Evaluation may be slow




The ``overall`` property now splits into more values:


.. code-block:: default

    cond_both.overall

The aggregates behave similarly. By this point, we are having significant issues
with under-populated intersections. Consider:


.. code-block:: default



    def member_counts(y_true, y_pred):
        assert len(y_true) == len(y_pred)
        return len(y_true)


    counts = MetricFrame(member_counts,
                         y_test, y_pred,
                         sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']],
                         control_features=A_test[['Loan Size', 'Credit Score']])

    counts.by_group
