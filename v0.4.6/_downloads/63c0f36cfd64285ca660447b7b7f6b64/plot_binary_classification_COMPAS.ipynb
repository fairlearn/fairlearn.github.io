        "Postprocessing the model to get a fair model\n============================================\n\nThe idea behind postprocessing is to alter the output of the\nfairness-unaware model to achieve fairness. The postprocessing algorithm\nrequires three input arguments: - the matrix of samples X - the vector\nof predictions y from the fairness-unaware model - the vector of group\nattribute values A (in the code we refer to it as sensitive\\_features)\n\nThe goal is to make the output fair with respect to constraints. The\npostprocessing algorithm uses one of\n\n-   Demographic Parity (DP):\n    $P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ A=a] = P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ ] \\qquad \\forall a, \\hat{y}$\n-   Equalized Odds (EO):\n    $P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ A=a, Y=y] = P\\ [\\ h(X)=\\hat{y}\\ |\\ Y=y\\ ] \\qquad \\forall a, \\hat{y}$\n\nwhere $h(X)$ is the prediction based on the input $X$, $\\hat{y}$ and $y$\nare labels, and $a$ is a sensitive feature value. In this example, we'd\nexpect the postprocessed model with DP to be balanced between races. In\nthis particular scenario it makes more sense to aim at fairness through\naccuracy like EO. EO does not make the same guarantees. Instead, it\nensures parity between the subgroups of each race with label 1 in the\ntraining set, and parity between the subgroups of each race with label 0\nin the training set. Applied to this scenario, this means that the\nsubgroups of each race who reoffended in the past are equally likely to\nbe predicted to reoffend (and therefore also equally likely not to).\nSimilarly, there is parity between subgroups of each race without\nrecidivism, but we have no parity between the groups with different\ntraining labels. In mathematical terms at the example of\nAfrican-American and Caucasian:\n\n> P\\[text{recidivism predicted}|text{African-American, recidivism}\\] =\n> P\\[text{recidivism predicted}|text{Caucasian, recidivism}\\], text{e.g.\n> } 0.95\n\n> P\\[text{recidivism predicted}|text{African-American, no recidivism}\\]\n> = P\\[text{recidivism predicted}|text{Caucasian, no recidivism}\\],\n> text{e.g. } 0.15\n\nbut that also means that African-Americans (and Caucasians) of different\nsubgroup based on training labels don't necessarily have parity:\n\n> P\\[text{recidivism predicted} | text{African-American, recidivism}\\] =\n> 0.95 neq 0.15 = P\\[text{recidivism predicted} | text{African-American,\n> no recidivism}\\]\n\nAssessing which disparity metric is indeed fair varies by application\nscenario. In this case the evaluation focuses on Equalized Odds, because\nthe recidivism prediction should be accurate for each race, and for each\nsubgroup within. The plot for the training data shows the intended\noutcome, while the plot for the test data exhibits slight variation\nwhich is likely due to randomized predictions as well as a slightly\ndifferent data distribution.\n\nThis wrapper around the unconstrained estimator serves the purpose of\nmapping the predict method to `predict_proba`\\` so that we can use real\nvalues to get more accurate estimates.\n"

The error\nin the chart is smallest in the top left corner. This is done as part of\nthe fit step above, and we'll repeat it here for completeness. The\nyellow area is the overlap between the areas under the curve that are\nreachable with interpolation for both groups. Of course, this works for\nmore than two groups as well.

That does not always happen,\nthough, and overlaps can be fairly complex with multiple intersecting\ncurves defining its outline.\n\nWe can actually even look up the specific interpolations and interpret\nthe results. Keep in mind that these interpolations come up with a\nfloating point number between 0 and 1, and represent the probability of\ngetting 0 or 1 in the predicted outcome.\n\nThe result for African-Americans is a combination of two thresholding\nrules. The first rule checks whether the score is above 0.542, the other\nwhether it is above 0.508. The first rule has a weight of 0.19, which\nmeans it determines 19% of the resulting probability. The second rule\ndetermines the remaining 81%. In the chart the Caucasian curve is below\nthe African-American curve at the EO solution. This means that there is\na slight adjustment according to the formula presented below.\n\nThe Caucasian rules have somewhat lower thresholds: The first rule's\nthreshold is &gt;0.421 and it is basically the deciding factor with a\nweight of 99.3%, while the second rule's threshold is &gt;0.404.\n\nOverall, this means that the postprocessing algorithm learned to get\nprobabilities consistent with Equalized Odds and minimal error by\nsetting lower thresholds for Caucasians than for African-Americans. The\nresulting probability from the formula below is then the probability to\nget label 1 from the probabilistic classifier.\n\nNote that this does not necessarily mean it's fair. It simply enforced\nthe constraints we asked it to enforce, as described by Equalized Odds.\nThe societal context plays a crucial role in determining whether this is\nfair.\n\nThe parameters p\\_ignore and prediction\\_constant are irrelevant for\ncases where the curves intersect in the minimum error point. When that\ndoesn't happen, and the minimum error point is only part of one curve,\nthen the interpolation is adjusted as follows:\n\n    p_ignore * prediction_constant + (1 - p_ignore) * (p0 * operation0(score) + p1 * operation1(score))\n\nThe adjustment should happen to the higher one of the curves and\nessentially brings it closer to the diagonal as represented by\nprediction\\_constant. In this case this is not required since the curves\nintersect, but we are actually slightly inaccurate because we only\ndetermine the minimum error point on a grid of x values, instead of\ncalculating the intersection point analytically. By choosing a large\ngrid\\_size this can be alleviated.\n"
