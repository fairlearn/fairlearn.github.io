Getting and preparing the data
------------------------------

To demonstrate the post processing algorithm we use the "COMPAS" dataset from
`ProPublica
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propublica/compas-analysis/master/compas-scores-two-years.csv>`_.
The labels represent the two-year recidivism ID, i.e. whether a person got
rearrested within two years (label 1) or not (label 0). The features include
sex, age, as well as information on prior incidents.

To start, let's download the dataset using `tempeh`


.. code-block:: default


    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from tempeh.configurations import datasets

    compas_dataset = datasets["compas"]()
    X_train, X_test = compas_dataset.get_X(format=pd.DataFrame)
    y_train, y_test = compas_dataset.get_y(format=pd.Series)
    (
        sensitive_features_train,
        sensitive_features_test,
    ) = compas_dataset.get_sensitive_features("race", format=pd.Series)
    X_train.loc[0], y_train[0]

To get started we look at a very basic Logistic Regression model. We fit it
to the training data and plot some characteristics of training and test data
as well as the predictions of the model on those datasets.

We notice a stark contrast in the predictions with African-Americans being a
lot more likely to be predicted to reoffend, similar to the original training
data. However, there's even a disparity between the subgroup of
African-Americans and Caucasians with recidivism. When considering only the
samples labeled with "no recidivism" African-Americans are much more likely
to be predicted to reoffend than Caucasians. The test data shows a similar
disparity.

Postprocessing the model to get a fair model
--------------------------------------------

The idea behind postprocessing is to alter the output of the fairness-unaware
model to achieve fairness. The postprocessing algorithm requires three input
arguments:
- the matrix of samples X
- the vector of predictions y from the fairness-unaware model
- the vector of group attribute values A (in the code we refer to it as `sensitive_features`)

The goal is to make the output fair with respect to constraints. The
postprocessing algorithm uses one of

- Demographic Parity (DP):
  :math:`P\ [\ h(X)=\hat{y}\ |\ A=a] = P\ [\ h(X)=\hat{y}\ ] \qquad \forall a, \hat{y}`
- Equalized Odds (EO):
  :math:`P\ [\ h(X)=\hat{y}\ |\ A=a, Y=y] = P\ [\ h(X)=\hat{y}\ |\ Y=y\ ] \qquad \forall a, \hat{y}`

where :math:`h(X)` is the prediction based on the input :math:`X`,
:math:`\hat{y}` and :math:`y` are labels, and :math:`a` is a sensitive feature
value. In this example, we'd expect the postprocessed model with DP to be
balanced between races. In this particular scenario it makes more sense to
aim at fairness through accuracy like EO. EO does not make the same
guarantees. Instead, it ensures parity between the subgroups of each race
with label 1 in the training set, and parity between the subgroups of each
race with label 0 in the training set. Applied to this scenario, this means
that the subgroups of each race who reoffended in the past are equally likely
to be predicted to reoffend (and therefore also equally likely not to).
Similarly, there is parity between subgroups of each race without recidivism,
but we have no parity between the groups with different training labels. In
mathematical terms at the example of African-American and Caucasian:

.. math::
  P\ [\ \text{recidivism predicted}\ |\ \text{African-American, recidivism}\ ] = P\ [\ \text{recidivism predicted}\ |\ \text{Caucasian, recidivism}\ ], \text{e.g. } 0.95

.. math::
  P\ [\ \text{recidivism predicted}\ |\ \text{African-American, no recidivism}\ ] = P\ [\ \text{recidivism predicted}\ |\ \text{Caucasian, no recidivism}\ ], \text{e.g. } 0.15

but that also means that African-Americans (and Caucasians) of different
subgroup based on training labels don't necessarily have parity:

.. math::
  P[\text{recidivism predicted} | \text{African-American, recidivism}] = 0.95 \neq 0.15 = P[\text{recidivism predicted} | \text{African-American, no recidivism}]

Assessing which disparity metric is indeed fair varies by application
scenario. In this case the evaluation focuses on Equalized Odds, because the
recidivism prediction should be accurate for each race, and for each subgroup
within. The plot for the training data shows the intended outcome, while the
plot for the test data exhibits slight variation which is likely due to
randomized predictions as well as a slightly different data distribution.

This wrapper around the unconstrained estimator serves the purpose of mapping
the predict method to ``predict_proba``` so that we can use real values to get
more accurate estimates.

Post Processing in Detail
-------------------------

While this worked as the numbers show, it's not entirely obvious how it found
its solution. The following section will provide a deep dive on post
processing for Equalized Odds (EO).

The post processing method (based on work by `Hardt, Price,
Srebro <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02413.pdf>`_) takes a fairness-unaware model
and disparity constraints (such as EO) in the constructor and features (X),
labels (y), and a sensitive feature (sensitive_features) in the fit method.
It subsequently uses the model to make predictions for all samples in X. Note
that these predictions could be 0/1 (as in this example), or more categories,
or even real valued scores. In this case, this looks as follows:


.. code-block:: default


    scores = estimator_wrapper.predict(X_train)
    scores





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    array([0.08323404, 0.43451484, 0.54980294, ..., 0.56740062, 0.22122327,
           0.37423461])



Finding threshold rules
***********************

The algorithm then tries to find all thresholding rules with which it could
divide the data. Any score for which the thresholding rule evaluates to true
is predicted to be 1. It does that for each group, so in this case for each
race. Depending on the unconstrained predictor's scores you could have lots
of thresholding rules, between each set of such values. For each rule we just
evaluate the following two probabilities empirically:

.. math::
  P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 0] \text{ which is labeled x below to indicate that it'll be plotted on the x-axis}

.. math::
  P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 1] \text{ which is labeled y below to indicate that it'll be plotted on the y-axis}

The former is the false negative rate (of that group), while the latter is
the true positive rate (of that group). In this example, the threshold rules
would be the ones shown below:


.. code-block:: default


    from fairlearn.postprocessing._threshold_optimizer import _reformat_and_group_data

    data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature = _reformat_and_group_data(
        sensitive_features_train, y_train.astype(int), scores
    )

    roc_points = {}
    for group_name, group in data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature:
        roc_points[group_name] = _calculate_roc_points(
            data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature.get_group(group_name), 0
        )

The base points with (x,y) as (0,0) and (1,1) always exist, because that
essentially just means that we're predicting everything as 0 or everything as
1 regardless of the scores from the fairness-unaware model. Let's look at
both cases:

- x=0, y=0, threshold rule ">inf": more than infinity is impossible, which
  means every sample is predicted as 0. That means :math:`P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y =
  0] = 0` (represented as x) because the predictions :math:`\hat{Y}` are
  never 1, and similarly :math:`P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 1] = 0` (represented as
  y).
- x=1, y=1, threshold rule ">-inf": more than infinity is always true, which
  means every sample is predicted as 1. That means :math:`P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y =
  0] = 1` (represented as x) because the predictions :math:`\hat{Y}` are
  always 1, and similarly :math:`P[\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 1] = 1` (represented as
  y).

The more interesting logic happens in between. The x and y values were
calculated as follows:


.. code-block:: default


    n_group_0 = {}
    n_group_1 = {}
    for group_name, group in data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature:
        print("{}:".format(group_name))
        n_group_1[group_name] = sum(group["label"])
        n_group_0[group_name] = len(group) - n_group_1[group_name]

        print("    number of samples with label 1: {}".format(n_group_1[group_name]))
        print("    number of samples with label 0: {}".format(n_group_0[group_name]))

    threshold = 0.5
    for group_name, group in data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature:
        x_group_0_5 = (
            sum((group["score"] > threshold) & (group["label"] == 0))
            / n_group_0[group_name]
        )
        y_group_0_5 = (
            sum((group["score"] > threshold) & (group["label"] == 1))
            / n_group_1[group_name]
        )
        print("{}:".format(group_name))
        print("    P[Ŷ = 1 | Y = 0] = {}".format(x_group_0_5))
        print("    P[Ŷ = 1 | Y = 1] = {}".format(y_group_0_5))

Note that it never makes sense to have :math:`x>y` because in that case you're
better off flipping labels, i.e. completely turning around the meaning of the
scores. The method automatically does that unless specified otherwise.

Interpolated Predictions and Probabilistic Classifiers
******************************************************

This way you end up with a set of points above the diagonal line connecting
(0,0) and (1,1). We calculate the convex hull based on that, because we can
reach any point in between two known thresholding points by interpolation. An
interpolation could be :math:`p_0 (x_0, y_0) + p_1 (x_1, y_1)`. For the post
processing algorithm that would mean that we use the rule defined by
:math:`(x_0, y_0, \text{operation}_0)` :math:`\quad p_0` percent of the time,
and the rule defined by :math:`(x_1, y_1, \text{operation}_1)` :math:`\quad
p_1` percent of the time, thus resulting in a probabilistic classifier.
Depending on the data certain fairness objectives can only be accomplished
with probabilistic classifiers. However, not every use case lends itself to
probabilistic classifiers, since it could mean that two people with identical
features are classified differently.

Finding the Equalized Odds solution
***********************************

From all the ROC points (see below) we need to extract the convex hull for
both groups/curves.


.. code-block:: default


    for group_name, group in data_grouped_by_sensitive_feature:
        plt.plot(roc_points[group_name].x, roc_points[group_name].y)
    plt.xlabel("$P [ \\hat{Y}=1 | Y=0 ]$")
    plt.ylabel("$P [ \\hat{Y}=1 | Y=1 ]$")
    plt.show()

    :alt: plot binary classification COMPAS
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





In the Equalized Odds case, we need to find a point where the presented
probabilities (false positive rate, true positive rate, and thereby also true
negative rate and false negative rate) for the corresponding groups match
while minimizing the error, which is equivalent to finding the minimum error
overlap of the convex hulls of the ROC curves. The error in the chart is
smallest in the top left corner. This is done as part of the `fit` step
above, and we'll repeat it here for completeness. The yellow area is the
overlap between the areas under the curve that are reachable with
interpolation for both groups. Of course, this works for more than two groups
as well. The result is that we have interpolated solutions for each group,
i.e. every prediction is calculated as the weighted result of two threshold
rules.

In this particular case the Caucasian curve is always below or matching the
African-American curve. That means that the area under the Caucasian curve is
also identical to the overlap. That does not always happen, though, and
overlaps can be fairly complex with multiple intersecting curves defining its
outline.

We can actually even look up the specific interpolations and interpret the
results. Keep in mind that these interpolations come up with a floating point
number between 0 and 1, and represent the probability of getting 0 or 1 in
the predicted outcome.

The result for African-Americans is a combination of two thresholding rules.
The first rule checks whether the score is above 0.542, the other whether it
is above 0.508. The first rule has a weight of 0.19, which means it
determines 19% of the resulting probability. The second rule determines the
remaining 81%. In the chart the Caucasian curve is below the African-American
curve at the EO solution. This means that there is a slight adjustment
according to the formula presented below.

The Caucasian rules have somewhat lower thresholds: The first rule's
threshold is >0.421 and it is basically the deciding factor with a weight of
99.3%, while the second rule's threshold is >0.404.

Overall, this means that the postprocessing algorithm learned to get
probabilities consistent with Equalized Odds and minimal error by setting
lower thresholds for Caucasians than for African-Americans. The resulting
probability from the formula below is then the probability to get label 1
from the probabilistic classifier.

Note that this does not necessarily mean it's fair. It simply enforced the
constraints we asked it to enforce, as described by Equalized Odds. The
societal context plays a crucial role in determining whether this is fair.

The parameters `p_ignore` and `prediction_constant` are irrelevant for cases
where the curves intersect in the minimum error point. When that doesn't
happen, and the minimum error point is only part of one curve, then the
interpolation is adjusted as follows::

  p_ignore * prediction_constant + (1 - p_ignore) * (p0 * operation0(score) + p1 * operation1(score))

The adjustment should happen to the higher one of the curves and essentially
brings it closer to the diagonal as represented by `prediction_constant`. In
this case this is not required since the curves intersect, but we are
actually slightly inaccurate because we only determine the minimum error
point on a grid of x values, instead of calculating the intersection point
analytically. By choosing a large `grid_size` this can be alleviated.
