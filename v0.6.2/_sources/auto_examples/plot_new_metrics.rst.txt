==============================
Metrics with Multiple Features
==============================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-53

This notebook demonstrates the new API for metrics, which supports
multiple sensitive and conditional features. This example does not
contain a proper discussion of how fairness relates to the dataset
used, although it does highlight issues which users may want to
consider when analysing their datasets.

We are going to consider a lending scenario, supposing that we have
a model which predicts whether or not a particular customer will
repay a loan. This could be used as the basis of deciding whether
or not to offer that customer a loan. With traditional metrics,
we would assess the model using:

- The 'true' values from the test set
- The model predictions from the test set

Our fairness metrics compute group-based fairness statistics.
To use these, we also need categorical columns from the test
set. For this example, we will include:

- The sex of each individual (two unique values)
- The race of each individual (three unique values)
- The credit score band of each individual (three unique values)
- Whether the loan is considered 'large' or 'small'

An individual's sex and race should not affect a lending decision,
but it would be legitimate to consider an individual's credit score
and the relative size of the loan which they desired.

A real scenario will be more complicated, but this will serve to
illustrate the use of the new metrics.

Getting the Data
================

*This section may be skipped. It simply creates a dataset for
illustrative purposes*

We will use the well-known UCI 'Adult' dataset as the basis of this
demonstration. This is not for a lending scenario, but we will regard
it as one for the purposes of this example. We will use the existing
'race' and 'sex' columns (trimming the former to three unique values),
and manufacture credit score bands and loan sizes from other columns.
We start with some uncontroversial `import` statements:

For purposes of clarity, we consolidate the 'race' column to have
three unique values:

Now, we manufacture the columns for the credit score band and
requested loan size. These are wholly constructed, and not
part of the actual dataset in any way. They are simply for
illustrative purposes.

Now that we have imported our dataset and manufactured a few features, we
can perform some more conventional processing. To avoid the problem of
`data leakage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)>`_,
we need to split the data into training and test sets before applying
any transforms or scaling:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-152

.. code-block:: default



    (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, A_train, A_test) = train_test_split(
        X_raw, y, A, test_size=0.3, random_state=54321, stratify=y
    )

    # Ensure indices are aligned between X, y and A,
    # after all the slicing and splitting of DataFrames
    # and Series

    X_train = X_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    X_test = X_test.reset_index(drop=True)
    y_train = y_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    y_test = y_test.reset_index(drop=True)
    A_train = A_train.reset_index(drop=True)
    A_test = A_test.reset_index(drop=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-162

Next, we build two :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects
to process the columns, one for numeric data, and the other
for categorical data. Both impute missing values; the difference
is whether the data are scaled (numeric columns) or
one-hot encoded (categorical columns). Imputation of missing
values should generally be done with care, since it could
potentially introduce biases. Of course, removing rows with
missing data could also cause trouble, if particular subgroups
have poorer data quality.

    numeric_transformer = Pipeline(
        steps=[

    )
    categorical_transformer = Pipeline(

    )

With our preprocessor defined, we can now build a
new pipeline which includes an Estimator:

Analysing the Model with Metrics
================================

After our data manipulations and model training, we have the following
from our test set:

- A vector of true values called ``y_test``
- A vector of model predictions called ``y_pred``
- A DataFrame of categorical features relevant to fairness called ``A_test``

In a traditional model analysis, we would now look at some metrics
evaluated on the entire dataset. Suppose in this case, the relevant
metrics are :func:`fairlearn.metrics.selection_rate` and
:func:`sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score` (with
``beta=0.6``).
We can evaluate these metrics directly:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 222-226

.. code-block:: default


    print("Selection Rate:", selection_rate(y_test, y_pred))
    print("fbeta:", skm.fbeta_score(y_test, y_pred, beta=0.6))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Selection Rate: 0.1947041561454992
    fbeta: 0.6827826864569057




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 227-233

We know that there are sensitive features in our data, and we want to
ensure that we're not harming individuals due to membership in any of
these groups. For this purpose, Fairlearn provides the
:class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
class. Let us construct an instance of this class, and then look at
its capabilities:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 233-242

.. code-block:: default


    fbeta_06 = functools.partial(skm.fbeta_score, beta=0.6)

    metric_fns = {'selection_rate': selection_rate, 'fbeta_06': fbeta_06}

    grouped_on_sex = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                 y_test, y_pred,
                                 sensitive_features=A_test['sex'])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 243-264

The :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object requires a
minimum of four arguments:

1. The underlying metric function(s) to be evaluated
2. The true values
3. The predicted values
4. The sensitive feature values

These are all passed as arguments to the constructor. If more than
one underlying metric is required (as in this case), then we must
provide them in a dictionary.

The underlying metrics must have a signature ``fn(y_true, y_pred)``,
so we have to use :func:`functools.partial` on ``fbeta_score()`` to
furnish ``beta=0.6`` (we will show how to pass in extra array
arguments such as sample weights shortly).

We will now take a closer look at the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
object. First, there is the ``overall`` property, which contains
the metrics evaluated on the entire dataset. We see that this contains the
same values calculated above:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 264-269

.. code-block:: default


    assert grouped_on_sex.overall['selection_rate'] == selection_rate(y_test, y_pred)
    assert grouped_on_sex.overall['fbeta_06'] == skm.fbeta_score(y_test, y_pred, beta=0.6)
    print(grouped_on_sex.overall)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    selection_rate    0.194704
    fbeta_06          0.682783
    dtype: object




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 270-274

The other property in the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object
is ``by_group``. This contains the metrics evaluated on each subgroup defined
by the categories in the ``sensitive_features=`` argument. In this case, we
have results for males and females:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 278-283

We can immediately see a substantial disparity in the selection rate between
males and females.

We can also create another :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object
using race as the sensitive feature:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 283-288

.. code-block:: default


    grouped_on_race = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                  y_test, y_pred,

.. code-block:: default

    assert (grouped_on_sex.overall == grouped_on_race.overall).all()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 293-295

column:

We see that there is also a significant disparity in selection rates when

Sample weights and other arrays
-------------------------------

We noted above that the underlying metric functions passed to the
:class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` constructor need to be of
the form ``fn(y_true, y_pred)`` - we do not support scalar arguments
such as ``pos_label=`` or ``beta=`` in the constructor. Such
arguments should be bound into a new function using
:func:`functools.partial`, and the result passed in. However, we do
support arguments which have one entry for each sample, with an array
of sample weights being the most common example. These are divided
into subgroups along with ``y_true`` and ``y_pred``, and passed along
to the underlying metric.

To use these arguments, we pass in a dictionary as the ``sample_params=``
argument of the constructor. Let us generate some random weights, and
pass these along:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 319-333

.. code-block:: default


    random_weights = np.random.rand(len(y_test))

    example_sample_params = {
        'selection_rate': {'sample_weight': random_weights},
        'fbeta_06': {'sample_weight': random_weights},
    }


    grouped_with_weights = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                       y_test, y_pred,

Quantifying Disparities
=======================

We now know that our model is selecting individuals who are female far less
often than individuals who are male. There is a similar effect when
examining the results by race, with blacks being selected far less often than
whites (and those classified as 'other'). However, there are many cases where
presenting all these numbers at once will not be useful (for example, a high
level dashboard which is monitoring model performance). Fairlearn provides
several means of aggregating metrics across the subgroups, so that disparities
can be readily quantified.

The simplest of these aggregations is ``group_min()``, which reports the
minimum value seen for a subgroup for each underlying metric (we also provide
``group_max()``). This is
useful if there is a mandate that "no subgroup should have an ``fbeta_score()``
of less than 0.6." We can evaluate the minimum values easily:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 363-365

    grouped_on_race.group_min()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    fbeta_06          0.592125
    dtype: object



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 366-370

As noted above, the selection rates varies greatly by race and by sex.
This can be quantified in terms of a difference between the subgroup with
the highest value of the metric, and the subgroup with the lowest value.
For this, we provide the method ``difference(method='between_groups)``:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 370-372

.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.difference(method='between_groups')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    selection_rate    0.142518
    fbeta_06          0.101591
    dtype: object



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 373-376

We can also evaluate the difference relative to the corresponding overall
value of the metric. In this case we take the absolute value, so that the
result is always positive:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 376-378

.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.difference(method='to_overall')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    fbeta_06          0.090657
    dtype: object



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 379-382

There are situations where knowing the ratios of the metrics evaluated on
the subgroups is more useful. For this we have the ``ratio()`` method.
We can take the ratios between the minimum and maximum values of each metric:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 382-384

.. code-block:: default

    grouped_on_race.ratio(method='between_groups')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    fbeta_06          0.853555
    dtype: object



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 385-388

We can also compute the ratios relative to the overall value for each
metric. Analogous to the differences, the ratios are always in the range
:math:`[0,1]`:

.. code-block:: default

Intersections of Features
=========================

So far we have only considered a single sensitive feature at a time,
and we have already found some serious issues in our example data.
However, sometimes serious issues can be hiding in intersections of
features. For example, the
`Gender Shades project <https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/gender-shades/overview/>`_
found that facial recognition algorithms performed worse for blacks
than whites, and also worse for women than men (despite overall high
accuracy score). Moreover, performance on black females was *terrible*.
We can examine the intersections of sensitive features by passing
multiple columns to the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame`
constructor:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 405-410

.. code-block:: default


    grouped_on_race_and_sex = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                          y_test, y_pred,
                                          sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 411-413

The overall values are unchanged, but the ``by_group`` table now
shows the intersections between subgroups:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 413-416

.. code-block:: default

    assert (grouped_on_race_and_sex.overall == grouped_on_race.overall).all()
    grouped_on_race_and_sex.by_group

The aggregations are still performed across all subgroups for each metric,
so each continues to reduce to a single value. If we look at the
``group_min()``, we see that we violate the mandate we specified for the
``fbeta_score()`` suggested above (for females with a race of 'Other' in
fact):

Control Features
================

There is a further way we can slice up our data. We have (*completely
made up*) features for the individuals' credit scores (in three bands)
and also the size of the loan requested (large or small). In our loan
scenario, it is acceptable that individuals with high credit scores
are selected more often than individuals with low credit scores.
However, within each credit score band, we do not want a disparity
between (say) black females and white males. To example these cases,
we have the concept of *control features*.

Control features are introduced by the ``control_features=``
argument to the :class:`fairlearn.metrics.MetricFrame` object:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 445-450

.. code-block:: default

    cond_credit_score = MetricFrame(metric_fns,
                                    y_test, y_pred,
                                    sensitive_features=A_test[['race', 'sex']],
                                    control_features=A_test['Credit Score'])
