<dt>Where can I learn more about fairness in machine learning?</dt><dd><p>Please review <a class="reference internal" href="user_guide/further_resources.html#further-resources"><span class="std std-ref">further resources</span></a>,
where we provide links to various materials that we have found helpful.
Also, in our <a class="reference internal" href="user_guide/index.html#user-guide"><span class="std std-ref">user guide</span></a>, we link to the papers describing
the algorithms implemented in Fairlearn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Why not just ignore the sensitive features?</dt><dd><p>If your goal is to train a model whose predictions are statistically
independent of the sensitive features, then it is not enough to simply ignore the
sensitive features.
Information is often redundantly encoded across several features, and machine learning
algorithms <em>will</em> uncover these links (it is what they are designed to do).
For example, in the US, the ZIP code where a person lives is well correlated with their
race.
Even if the model is not provided with race as a feature, the model will pick up on it
implicitly via the ZIP code (and other features).
Worse, without having the race available in the dataset, it is hard to assess the
model’s impact across different groups defined by race or by race intersected with other
demographic features.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The model is unfair because the data are biased. Isn’t it better to get better data?</dt><dd><p>The answer to this question depends on what is meant by ‘unfair’, ‘biased data’,
and ‘better data’ in any particular context.
Consider the example of a company seeking to build a tool for screening the resumes of
job candidates.
The company is planning to use their internal job evaluation data and train a
model to predict job evaluations of the applicants; those with higher
predictions will be ranked higher by the screening tool. This setup might
present several fairness issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the company has historically hired few women, there will be fewer of them
in the training data set, and so a trained model may be less accurate
for them.</p></li>
<li><p>The choice of features also affects the accuracy of the model. The features
that are predictive for one group of applicants might not be as predictive for another
group, and so more data will not necessarily improve the accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>The accuracy of a model might not mean that the model is fair. If women have received
systematically poorer reviews due to biased managers or worse workplace conditions,
then the model might appear to be accurate,
but the choice of the label (in this case, job evaluation)
does not accurately reflect the applicants’ potential.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just three ways how the data may be ‘biased’, and they are not mutually
exclusive. The processes for getting ‘better data’ will be different for
each. In some of these cases, obtaining ‘better data’ may not be practical, but it
might still be possible to use some mitigation algorithms.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Why am I seeing fairness issues, even though my data are reflective of the general population?</dt><dd><p>Machine learning models often perform poorly for subgroups which are poorly
represented.
What constitutes poor representation is context specific, and may well be affected by
historical misrepresentation (consider the example above, of a company which had previously
hired few women).
For this reason, balanced sampling is generally better for ML than population sampling.
On a related point, this is why it is important to consider multiple fairness metrics,
and how they vary across different subgroups.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Won’t making a model fairer reduce its accuracy?</dt><dd><p>There are often many machine learning models that achieve similar levels of accuracy
or other performance metrics, but that dramatically differ in how they affect
different subgroups.
Mitigation algorithms seek to improve the fairness metrics without strongly affecting
the accuracy, or more generally to navigate the trade-offs between performance and
fairness metrics.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can the mitigation algorithms in Fairlearn make my model fair?</dt><dd><p>There are many ways in which a model can be unfair. Fairlearn mitigation algorithms
only address some of them: those that can be quantified by our supported
fairness metrics.
However, to assess whether the new model is fairer, it is important to consider
not only the fairness metrics, but also the societal and technical context in which
the model is applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt>I’ve got improved data, trained and mitigated new models, checked all the metrics… am I done?</dt><dd><p>Firstly, always remember that there is more to fairness than technical details such as
metrics - fairness is a <em>sociotechnical</em> problem.
Even if these are all considered at training time, the ML lifecycle doesn’t end when a
model is deployed.
Models need to be monitored in production.
On a technical level, this means checking for data drift within the vulnerable
subgroups identified during the fairness analysis.
However the societal aspects need to be considered as well, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are the actual harms as expected, both in the nature of the harms and their
distribution?</p></li>
<li><p>Have the users of the model (who may not be the subjects of the model)
adjusted their usage patterns? This is sometimes called ‘strategic
behavior.’</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>What sort of fairness-related harms can the Fairlearn library address?</dt><dd><p>We currently focus on two kinds of harms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Allocation harms.</em>
These harms can occur when AI systems extend or withhold opportunities, resources,
or information. Some of the key applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Quality-of-service harms.</em> Quality of service refers to whether a system works
as well for one person as it does for another, even if no opportunities, resources,
or information are extended or withheld.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Can the Fairlearn library be used to detect bias in datasets?</dt><dd><p>We do not have concrete plans for this at the present time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can the Fairlearn library recommend ways to make my model fairer?</dt><dd><p>Right now we do not have an automated tool that would help you decide
which mitigation algorithm to use. Our focus is on expanding the documentation
and examples to highlight when each of the algorithms might be more applicable.
Note that model training is just one step in the AI development and
deployment lifecycle, and other steps, such as data gathering and curation,
or monitoring and debugging of the deployed system, may be better places
of intervention to improve the fairness of an AI system.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What unfairness mitigation techniques does Fairlearn support?</dt><dd><p>Please see our <a class="reference internal" href="user_guide/mitigation.html#mitigation"><span class="std std-ref">Mitigation</span></a> section.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Which ML libraries does Fairlearn support?</dt><dd><p>We have generally followed conventions of <cite>scikit-learn</cite>.
However, our mitigation algorithms can be used to augment
any ML algorithms that provide (or can be wrapped to provide) <cite>fit()</cite> and
<cite>predict()</cite> methods. Also, any classification or regression
algorithm can be evaluated using our metrics.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does Fairlearn support multi-class classification?</dt><dd><p>On the assessment side, Fairlearn’s <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MetricFrame</span></code> can be used with
any metrics for supervised learning, including those for multi-class classification.
For example, it is possible to pass
<a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score" title="(in scikit-learn v0.24)"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score()</span></code></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html#sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix" title="(in scikit-learn v0.24)"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix()</span></code></a>
as the metric functions, and supply multi-class data for <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y_true</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y_pred</span></code>.
There are
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/752">ongoing discussions within the community</a>
to add more extensive support to Fairlearn’s assessment capabilities.
If you have thoughts feel free to add them to the discussion.</p>
<p>On the mitigation side, our algorithms <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ExponentiatedGradient</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GridSearch</span></code>
support <span class="xref std std-ref">bounded group loss</span> constraints, which are applicable
to any supervised learning setting, including multi-class classification.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does Fairlearn support multiple and non-binary sensitive features?</dt><dd><p>Fairlearn’s assessment capabilities support sensitive features with more
than two values as well as multiple sensitive features.
Our <a class="reference internal" href="user_guide/assessment.html#metrics-with-grouping"><span class="std std-ref">user guide</span></a> has examples for both of
these cases.
The mitigation techniques all support mitigation with non-binary and
multiple sensitive features as well. For a full list of techniques
please refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="user_guide/mitigation.html#mitigation"><span class="std std-ref">user guide section on mitigation</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does Fairlearn work for image and text data?</dt><dd><p>We have not (yet) looked at using Fairlearn on image or text data.
However, so long as the image or text classifier provide
<code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit()</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict()</span></code> methods
as required by Fairlearn, it should be possible to use them
with Fairlearn mitigation algorithms. Also, any classification or regression
algorithm can be evaluated using our metrics (regardless of the
data it is operating on).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Is Fairlearn available in languages other than Python?</dt><dd><p>For the moment, we only support Python &gt;= 3.6</p>
</dd>
<dt>Can I contribute to Fairlearn?</dt><dd><p>Absolutely! Please see our <a class="reference internal" href="contributor_guide/index.html#contributor-guide"><span class="std std-ref">contributor guide</span></a> to see
how. We welcome all contributions!</p>
</dd>
<dt>What is the relationship between Fairlearn and Microsoft?</dt><dd><p>Fairlearn has grown from a project at Microsoft Research in New York City.</p>
