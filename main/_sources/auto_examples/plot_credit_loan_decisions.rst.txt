Fairness considerations of credit loan decisions
------------------------------------------------

Fairness and credit lending in the US
=====================================

In 2019, Apple received backlash on social media after its newly launched
*Apple Card* product appeared to offer higher credit limits to men compared
to women :footcite:`nedlund2019apple`.
In multiple cases, married couples found the husband received a credit limit
that was 10-20x higher than the wife's even when the couple had joint assets.

From a regulatory perspective, financial institutions that operate within
the United States are subject to *legal regulations* prohibiting
discrimination on the `basis of race, gender, or other protected classes
:footcite:`uscode2011title15chapter41subchapteriv`.
With the increasing prevalence of automated decision-systems in the financial
lending space, experts have raised concerns about whether these systems could
exacerabate existing inequalities in financial lending.

Although the two concepts are intertwined, algorithmic fairness is not the
same concept as anti-discrimination law. An AI system can comply with
anti-discrimination law while exhibiting fairness-related concerns. On the
other hand, some fairness interventions may be illegal under
anti-discrimination law.
:footcite:cts:`Xiang2019legalcompatibility` discuss the compatibilities and
disconnects between anti-discrimination law and algorithmic notions of
fairness. In this case study, we focus on fairness in financial services
rather than compliance with financial anti-discrimination regulations.

Ernst & Young (EY) case study
-----------------------------

In this case study, we aim to replicate the work done in a white paper
:footcite:`dudik2020assessing`,
co-authored by *Microsoft* and *EY*, on mitigating gender-related performance
disparities in financial lending decisions. In their analysis, Microsoft and
EY demonstrated how Fairlearn could be used to measure and mitigate
unfairness in the loan adjudication process.

Using a dataset of credit loan outcomes (whether an individual defaulted on
a credit loan), we train a fairness-unaware model to predict the likelihood
an individual will default on a given loan. We use the Fairlearn toolkit for
assessing the fairness of our model, according to several metrics.
Finally, we perform two unfairness mitigation strategies on our model and
compare the results to our original model.

Because the dataset used in the white paper is not publicly available, we
will introduce a semi-synthetic feature into an existing publicly available
dataset to replicate the outcome disparity found in the original dataset.

Credit decisions dataset
========================

As mentioned, we will not be able to use the original loans dataset, and
instead will be working with a publicly available dataset of credit card
defaults in Taiwan collected in 2005. This dataset represents binary credit
card default outcomes for 30,000 applicants with information pertaining to
an applicant's payment history and bill statements over a six-month period
from April 2005 to September 2005, as well as demographic information, such
as *sex*, *age*, *marital status*, and *education level* of the applicant.
A full summary of features is provided below:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :stub-columns: 1

  *  - features
     - description
  *  - sex, education, marriage, age
     - demographic features
  *  - pay_0, pay_2, pay_3, pay_4, pay_5, pay_6
     - repayment status (ordinal)
  *  - bill_amt1, bill_amt2, bill_amt3, bill_amt4, bill_amt5, bill_amt_6
     - bill statement amount (Taiwan dollars)
  *  - pay_amt1, pay_amt2, pay_amt3, pay_amt4, pay_amt5, pay_amt6
     - previous statement amount (Taiwan dollars)
  *  - default payment next month
     - default information (1 = YES, 0 = NO)

Let's pretend we are a data scientist at a financial institution who is
tasked with developing a classification model to predict whether an
applicant will default on a personal loan. A positive prediction by the
model means the applicant would default on the credit loan.
*Defaulting on a loan* means the client fails to make payments within a
30-day window, and the lender can take legal actions against the client.

Although we do not have a dataset of loan default history, we do have this
data set of credit card payment history. We assume customers who make
monthly credit card payments on time are more *creditworthy*, and thus less
likely to default on a personal credit loan.

**Decision point: task definition**

- **Defaulting on a credit card payment** can be viewed as a proxy for the
  fact that an applicant might not be a good candidate for a personal loan.
- Because most customers did not default on their credit card payment, we
  will need to take this class imbalance into account during our modeling
  process.

As the data is read in-memory, we will change the column :code:`PAY_0` to
:code:`PAY_1` to make the naming more consistent with the naming of the
other columns.
In addition, the target variable :code:`default payment next month` is
changed to :code:`default` to reduce verbosity.

From the `dataset description :footcite:`yeh2009comparisons`,
we see there are three categorical features:

- :code:`SEX`: Sex of the applicant (as a binary feature)
- :code:`EDUCATION`: Highest level of education achieved by the applicant.
- :code:`MARRIAGE`: Marital status of the applicant.

Dataset imbalances
==================

Before we start training a classifier model, we want to explore the
dataset for any characteristics that may lead to fairness-related harms
later on in the modeling process.
In particular, we will focus on the distribution of sensitive feature
:code:`SEX` and the target label :code:`default`.

As part of an exploratory data analysis, let's explore the distribution of
our sensitive feature :code:`SEX`. We see that 60% of loan applicants were
labeled as `female` and 40% as `male`, so we do not need to worry about
imbalance in this feature.

    male      0.396267
    Name: proportion, dtype: float64



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 197-206

Next, let's explore the distribution of the *loan default rate* :code:`Y`.
We see that around 78% of individuals in the dataset do not default on their
credit loan. While the target label does not display extreme imbalance, we
will need to account for this imbalance in our modeling section. As opposed
to the *sensitive feature* :code:`SEX`, an imbalance in the target label may
result in a classifier that over-optimizes for the majority class.
For example, a classifier that predicts an applicant will not default would
achieve an accuracy of 78%, so we will use the :code:`balanced_accuracy`
score as our evaluation metric to counteract the label imbalance.

Add synthetic noise that is related to the outcome and sex
==========================================================

For the purpose of this case study, we add a synthetic feature
:code:`Interest` that introduces correlation between the :code:`SEX` label
of an applicant and the :code:`default` outcome.
The purpose of this feature is to replicate outcome disparities present in
the original dataset.
We can think of this :code:`Interest` feature as the *interest rate* for
the applicant.
If the applicant has a history of defaulting on credit card payments, the
bank will lend to the applicant at a higher interest rate.
We also assume because banks have historically lended primarily to men,
there is less uncertainty (or variance) in the *interest rate* for these
applicants.

To reflect the above reasoning, the :code:`Interest` feature is drawn from a
*Gaussian distribution* with the following criterion:

* If *Male*, draw :code:`Interest` from
  :math:`\mathcal{N}(2 \cdot \text{Default}, 1)`
* If *Female*, draw :code:`Interest` from
  :math:`\mathcal{N}(2 \cdot \text{Default}, 2)`

This feature is drawn from a *Gaussian distribution* for computational
simplicity.

Check if this will lead to disparity in naive model
===================================================

Now that we have created our synthetic feature, let's check how this new
feature interacts with our *sensitive_feature* :code:`Sex` and our target
label :code:`default`.
We see that for both sexes, the :code:`Interest` feature is higher for
individuals who defaulted on their loan.

This is to be expected given the :code:`INTEREST` feature provides a

As a model validation check, let's explore the feature importances of our
classifier.
As expected, our synthetic feature :code:`INTEREST` has the highest feature

Fairness assessment of unmitigated model
----------------------------------------

Now that we have trained our initial fairness-unaware model, let's perform
our fairness assessment for this model. When conducting a fairness assessment,
there are three main steps we want to perform:

1. Identify who will be harmed.
2. Identify the types of harms we anticipate.
3. Define fairness metrics based on the anticipated harms.

Who will be harmed?
===================

Based on the incident with *Apple* credit card mentioned at the beginning
of this notebook, we believe the model may incorrectly predict women will
default on the credit loan. The system may unfairly allocate less loans to
women and over-allocate loans to men.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 384-458

Types of harm experienced
=========================

When discussing fairness in AI systems, the first step is understanding
what types of harms we anticipate the system may produce. Using the
:ref:`harms taxonomy in the Fairlearn User Guide <types_of_harms>`,
we expect this system to produce *harms of allocation*. In addition, we also
anticipate the long-term impact on an individual's credit score if an
individual is unable to repay a loan they receive or if they are rejected for
a loan application. A *harm of allocation* occurs when an AI system extends or
withholds resources, opportunities, information. In this scenario, the AI
system is extending or withholding financial assets from individuals. A review
of historical incidents shows these types of automated lending decision
systems may discriminate unfairly based on sex.

**Negative impact of credit score**

A secondary harm that is somewhat unique to credit lending decisions is the
long-term impact on an individual's credit score. In the United States, a
`FICO credit score <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp>`_
is a number between 300 and 850 that represents a customer's
*creditworthiness*. An applicant's *credit score* is used by many financial
institutions for lending decisions. An applicant's *credit score* usually
increases after a successful repayment of a loan and decreases if the
applicant fails to repay the loan.

When applying for a credit loan, there are three major outcomes:

1. The individual receives the credit loan and pays back the loan. In this
   scenario, we expect the individual's credit score to increase as a result
   of the successful repayment of the loan.

2. The individual receives the credit loan but defaults on the loan. In this
   scenario, the individual's credit score will drop drastically due to the
   failure to repay the loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to
   a **false negative** (the model predicts the individual will repay the
   loan, but the individual is unsuccessful in doing so).

3. In certain countries, such as the United States, an individual receives a
   small drop (up to five points) to their credit score after a lender
   performs a *hard inquiry* on the applicant's credit history. If the
   applicant applies for a loan but does not receive it, the small decrease in
   their credit score will impact their ability to successfully apply for a
   future loan. In the modeling process, this outcome is tied to the
   **selection rate** (the proportion of positive predictions outputted by the
   model).

**Prevention of wealth accumulation**

One other type of harm we anticipate in this scenario is the long-term
effects of *denying loans to applicants who would have successfully paid back
the loan*. By receiving a loan, an applicant is able to purchase a home, start
a business, or pursue some other economic activity that they are not able to
do otherwise. These outcomes are tied to **false positive error** rates in
which the model predicts an applicant will default on the loan, but the
individual would have successfully paid the loan back. In the United States,
the practice of redlining :footcite:`peyton2020redlining`, denying mortgage loans
and other financial services to predominantly Black or other minority
communities, has resulted in a vast racial wealth gap between white and Black
Americans.
Although the practice of redlining was banned in 1968 with the
*Fair Housing Act*, the long-term impact of these practices
:footcite:`jan2018redlining` is reflected in the lack of economic investment
in Black communities, and Black applicants are denied loans at a higher rate
compared to white Americans.

Define fairness metrics based on harms
--------------------------------------

Now that we have identified the relevant harms we anticipate users will
experience, we can define our fairness metrics. In addition to the metrics, we
will quantify the uncertainty around each metric using *custom functions* to
compute the *standard error* for each metric at the :math:`\alpha=0.95` confidence
level.

Finally, let's compute the :code:`equalized_odds_difference` for this unmitigated
model. The :code:`equalized_odds_difference` is the maximum of the
:code:`false_positive_rate_difference` and :code:`false_negative_rate_difference`. In our
lending context, both *false_negative_rate_disparities* and
*false_positive_rate_disparities* result in fairness-related harms. Therefore,
we attempt to minimize both of these metrics by minimizing the
:code:`equalized_odds_difference`.

One key assumption here is we assume that *false positives* and *false
negatives* have the equally adverse costs to each group. In practice, we would
develop some weighting mechanism to assign a weight to each *false negative*
and *false positive* event.

Mitigating Unfairness in ML models
----------------------------------
In the previous section, we identified disparities in the model's
performance with respect to :code:`SEX`. In particular, we found that model produces
a significantly higher :code:`false_negative_rate` and :code:`false_positive_rate` for the
applicants labeled :code:`female` compared to those labeled :code:`male`. In the context
of credit decision scenario, this means the model under-allocates loans to
*women* who would have paid the loan, but over-allocates loans to *women* who
go on to default on their loan.

In this section, we will discuss strategies for mitigating the performance
disparities we found in our unmitigated model. We will apply two different
mitigation strategies:

- *Postprocessing*: In the postprocessing approach, the outputs of a trained
  classifier are transformed to satisfy some fairness criterion.
- *Reductions*: In the reductions approach, we take in a model class and
  iteratively create a sequence of models that optimize some fairness
  constraint. Compared to the *postprocessing* approach, the fairness
  constraint is satisfied during the model training time rather than
  afterwards.

Postprocessing mitigations: ThresholdOptimizer
==============================================
In the Fairlearn package, *postprocessing* mitigation is offered through
the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` algorithm, following
:footcite:cts:`hardt2016equality`.
The :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` takes in an existing (possibly pre-fit)
machine learning model whose predictions acts as a scoring function to
identify separate thresholds for each *sensitive feature* group.
The :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` optimizes a specified objective metric
(in our case, :code:`balanced_accuracy`) subject to some fairness constraint
(`equalized_odds`), resulting in a thresholded version of the underlying
machine learning model.

To instantiate our :code:`ThresholdOptimizer`, we need to specify our fairness
constraint as a model parameter. Because both :code:`false_negative_rate`
disparities and :code:`false_positive_rate` disparities translate into real-world
harms in our scenario, we will aim to minimize the :code:`equalized_odds` difference
as our *fairness constraint*.

One key limitation of the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` is the need for sensitive
features during training and prediction time. If we do not have access to the
:code:`sensitive_features` during prediction time, we cannot use the
:code:`ThresholdOptimizer`.

We pass in :code:`A_train` to the :code:`fit` function with the
:code:`sensitive_features` parameter.

We see that the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` algorithm achieves a much lower
disparity between the two groups compared to the *unmitigated* model.
However, this does come with the trade-off that the
:code:`ThresholdOptimizer` achieves a lower :code:`balanced_accuracy` score
for *male* applicants.

Reductions approach to unfairness mitigation
--------------------------------------------
In the previous section, we took a fairness-unaware model and used the
:code:`ThresholdOptimizer` to transform the model's decision boundary to
satisfy our fairness constraints.
One key limitation of the :code:`ThresholdOptimizer` is needing access to
our *sensitive_feature* during prediction time.

In this section, we will use the *reductions* approach of Agarwal et. al
(2018) :footcite:`agarwal2018reductions` to produce models that satisfy
the fairness constraint without needing access to the sensitive features at
deployment time.

The main reduction algorithm in Fairlearn is :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`.
The algorithm creates a sequence of re-weighted datasets and retrains the
wrapped classifier on each of the datasets.
This re-training process is guaranteed to find a model that satisfies the
fairness constraints while optimizing the performance metric.

The model returned by :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` consists of several inner
models, returned by a wrapped estimator.

To instantiate an :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` model, we pass in two
parameters:

- a base :code:`estimator` (object that supports training)
- fairness :code:`constraints` (object of type :class:`fairlearn.reductions.Moment`)

When passing in a fairness *constraint* as a :code:`Moment`, we can specify
an :code:`epsilon` value representing the maximum allowed difference or ratio
between our largest and smallest value.
For example, in the below code,
:code:`EqualizedOdds(difference_bound=epsilon)` means that we are using
:code:`EqualizedOdds` as our fairness constraint, and we will allow a
maximal difference of :code:`epsilon` between our largest and smallest
*equalized odds* value.

Because the *performance-fairness trade-off* learned by the
:code:`ExponentiatedGradient` model is sensitive to our chosen
:code:`epsilon` value, we can treat :code:`epsilon` as a *hyperparameter*
and iterate over a range of potential values.
Here, we will train two :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` models, one with
:code:`epsilon=0.01` and the second with :code:`epsilon=0.02`, and store the
inner models learned through each of the training processes.

In practice, we recommend choosing smaller values of :code:`epsilon` on
the order of the *square root* of the number of samples in the training
dataset:
:math:`\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\text{numberSamples}}} \approx \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{25000}} \approx 0.01`

Here, we can see all the inner models learned for each value of
:code:`epsilon`.
With the :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` model, we specify an :code:`epsilon`
parameter that represents the maximal disparity in our fairness metric that
our final model should satisfy.
For example, an :code:`epsilon=0.02` means that the training value of the
*equalized odds difference* of the returned model is at most :code:`0.02`
(if the algorithm converges).

Reviewing inner models of ExponentiatedGradient
===============================================
In many situations due to regulation or other technical restrictions, the
randomized nature of :code:`ExponentiatedGradient` algorithm may be
undesirable.
In addition, the multiple inner models of the algorithm introduce challenges
for model interpretability.
One potential workaround to avoid these issues is to select one of the inner
models and deploy it instead.

In the previous section, we trained multiple :code:`ExponentiatedGradient`
models at different :code:`epsilon` levels and collected all the inner
models learned by this process.
When picking a suitable inner model, we consider trade-offs between
our two metrics of interest: *balanced error rate* and *equalized odds difference*.
Since our focus is on these two metrics, we will filter out
the models that are outperformed in both of the metrics by some other
model (we refer to these as *"dominated"* models), and plot just the remaining
*"undominated"* models.

With the above plot, we can see how the performance of the non-dominated
inner models compares to the original unmitigated model. In many cases, we see
that a reduction in the :code:`equalized_odds_difference` is accompanied by a small
increase in the *weighted error rate*.

Selecting a suitable inner model
================================
One strategy we can use to select a model is creating a *threshold* based
on the *balanced error rate* of the unmitigated model. Then out of the
filtered models, we select the model that minimizes the
:code:`equalized_odds_difference`. The process can be broken down into the three
steps below:

1. Create threshold based on :code:`balanced_error` of the unmitigated model.
2. Filter only models whose :code:`balanced_error` are below the threshold.
3. Choose the model with smallest :code:`equalized_odds` difference.

Within the context of fair lending in the United States, if a financial
institution is found to be engaging in discriminatory behavior, they must
produce documentation that demonstrates the model chosen is the least
discriminatory model while satisfying profitability and other business needs.
In our approach, the business need of profitability is simulated by
thresholding based on the :code:`balanced_error` rate of the unmitigated model, and
we choose the least discriminatory model based on the smallest
:code:`equalized_odds_difference` value.

We see both of our fairness-aware models yield a slight decrease in the
*balanced_accuracy* for *male applicants* compared to our fairness-unaware
model. In the *reductions* model, we see a decrease in the
*false positive rate* for *female applicants*. This is accompanied by an increase
in the *false negative rate* for *male applicants*. However overall, the
*equalized odds difference* for the *reductions* models is lower
than that of the original fairness-unaware model.

Conclusion and Discussion
----------------------------

In this case study, we walked through the process of assessing a credit
decision model for gender-related performance disparities.
Our analysis follows closely the work done in the Microsoft/EY white paper
:footcite:`dudik2020assessing` where they used the *Fairlearn* toolkit to
perform an audit of a fairness-unaware tree-based model.
We applied a *postprocessing* and *reductions* mitigation techniques to
mitigate the *equalized odds difference* in our model.

Through the *reductions* process, we generated a model that reduces the
*equalized odds difference* of the original model without a drastic increase
in the *balanced error score*. If this were a real model being developed a
financial institution, the *balanced error score* would be a proxy for the
profitability of the model. By maintaining a relatively similar *balanced
error score*, we've produced a model that preserves profitability to the firm
while producing more fair and equitable outcomes for women in this scenario.

Designing a Model Card
======================

A key facet of Responsible Machine Learning is responsible documentation
practices. :footcite:ct:`mitchell2019model`
proposed the model card framework for documentating and reporting model
training details and deployment considerations.

A *model card* contains sections for documenting training and evaluation
dataset descriptions, ethical concerns, and quantitative evaluation summaries.
In practice, we would ideally create a model card for our model before
deploying it in production. Although we will not be producing a model card in
this case study, interested readers can learn more about creating model cards
using the *Model Card Toolkit* from the
`Fairlearn PyCon tutorial <https://github.com/fairlearn/talks/tree/main/2022_pycon>`_.

Fairness under unawareness
==========================

When proving credit models are compliant with fair lending laws,
practitoners may run into the issue of not having access to the sensitive
demographic features. As a result, financial institutions are often tasked
with proving their models are compliant with fair lending laws by imputing
these demographics features. However, :footcite:ct:`chen2019fairness` show
these imputation methods often introduce new fairness-related issues.
